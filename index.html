    <!--Bio-->

    <div class="Bio">
        I love board games.  I play a lot of different ones, but the ones we keep coming back to week after weeks are Aeon's End, Pandemic, and Betrayal at House on the Hill.  I really like having a story in the games; so, personally, I really like the Legacy style of games.  However, my favorite game is Mice and Mystics.

        I also love video games.  Currently, I play a lot of Apex Legends, but I'm also playing Assassin's Creed: Origins and Dead by Daylight.  I used to love playing competitive games, but, as I've gotten older and a family, I don't have as much time to play any more.  With less time to play, the younger generation seems to be passing me by; thus, making me love story driven or cooperative games more.

        My final favorite hobby is sports.  I love playing sports, I love watching sports, I love talking sports, and if it's sports related, I probably love that, too.  All time favorite sport to play is soccer.  Though, I really enjoyed hockey as well, I wasn't very good.  My favorite sport to watch is football, closely followed by hockey and soccer.  My favorite teams are the Dallas Cowboys, the Dallas Stars, and Arsenal.  Due to my daughter's interest, I'm starting to grow my interest in basketball and the Dallas Mavericks, again.
